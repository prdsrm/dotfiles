# Dotfiles for server

1. Install Nix
2. Run `nix-shell`
3. Run `make build`
4. Enjoy

## Warning

I used to configure my system a lot. I've been using NixOS for a while, with the average https://reddit.com/r/unixporn setup, however I stopped, because it is useless.
I do not use these dotfiles anymore.
But I still use https://github.com/helix-editor/helix, its great.
